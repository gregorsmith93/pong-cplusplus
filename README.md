# pong-cplusplus
Just trying to learn C++ by creating Pong from scratch. Most likely won't be following best practices, but if this works I might refactor to be better.

Uses the WINAPI framework to create a windows desktop application in C++ which is just Pong. This repository is just for learning purposes.
